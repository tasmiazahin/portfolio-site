## Description

Created a personal website from scratch with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Added some annimation in landing page background where background changes dinamically and also made significant effort to make the website responsive.

I have tried to wotk Github API tp fetch  my public repositories and added them to my portfoilo. I have added information in my CV page from JSON data file. In my contact page, I have added a modal to show that contact form has submitted (no validation has added yet) because no smtp (simple mail transfer protocol) is allowed to use in the project description.
